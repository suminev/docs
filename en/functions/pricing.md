# {{ sf-name }} pricing




## What is included in the {{ sf-name }} cost {#rules}

In {{ sf-name }}, you pay for the number of function calls, computing resources allocated for the function, downtime of [provisioned instances](concepts/function.md#provisioned-instances), and outgoing traffic.

When billing computing resources (GB × hour), the memory allocated for the function and function execution time are taken into account:
* The amount of memory specified when [creating a version](operations/function/version-manage.md), in GB.
* The execution time for each function call in hours, rounded up to the nearest multiple of 100 ms.

{% note warning %}

You are only charged for the [function calls](concepts/function-invoke.md) that triggered your code to run.

{% endnote %}




### Pricing formula {#price-formula}

Monthly cost = $0.043760 × Memory (GB) × Call processing time (Hours) + $0.12800 × Millions of calls

{% include [free-tier.md](../_includes/pricing/price-formula/free-tier.md) %}


### Example of cost calculation {#price-example}

{% include [prices-example](../_includes/functions/prices-example.md) %}

## Using triggers {#triggers}

[Triggers](concepts/trigger/index.md) can be used free of charge. You can create and use triggers within the available [quotas and limits](concepts/limits.md).



## Alice skills

{{ sf-name }} functions used for Alice skills are not billable and do not consume your [free amount of services](../billing/concepts/serverless-free-tier.md#sf), if:
* The function is invoked by the [Yandex Dialogs platform](https://yandex.ru/dev/dialogs/).
* The Alice's skill was created by the [instructions](https://yandex.ru/dev/dialogs/alice/doc/deploy-ycloud-function.html#deploy-ycloud-function__register).

However, if the function uses other {{ yandex-cloud }} resources, they are billed. For example, if the function makes requests to the {{ message-queue-name }} queue, the requests are billed according to the [pricing](../message-queue/pricing.md#requests-to-queues).



## Pricing {#prices}

### Invoking a function {#invoke}




{% include [usd.md](../_pricing/functions/usd-invocations.md) %}

You pay for the actual number of invocations. For example, given that 1,000,000 calls cost $0.128000, 1,000 calls in excess of the free amount will cost $0.000128.


### Function execution time {#execution}




{% include [usd.md](../_pricing/functions/usd-compute.md) %}




### Provisioned instances {#provisioned-instances}




{% include [usd.md](../_pricing/functions/usd-compute-provisioned-instances.md) %}




### Egress traffic {#prices-traffic}




{% include notitle [usd-egress-traffic.md](../_pricing/usd-egress-traffic.md) %}
