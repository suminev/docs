# Deleting a project

To delete a project, you need the `{{ roles-speechsense-admin }}` role for either the space or the project you want to delete.

To delete a project:

1. Open the {{ speechsense-name }} [home page]({{ link-speechsense-main }}).
1. Go to the space you need and select the appropriate project.
1. In the top-right corner, click **More** → ![delete](../../../_assets/console-icons/trash-bin.svg) **Delete**.
1. Confirm project deletion.
