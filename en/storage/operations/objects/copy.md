# Copying objects

{{ objstorage-name }} supports _server-side object copy_.

If [encryption](../../concepts/encryption.md) in a [bucket](../../concepts/bucket.md) is disabled, [objects](../../concepts/object.md) will be copied to server-side buckets. The host on which the copy operation is run and {{ objstorage-name }} exchange nothing but object [keys](../../concepts/object.md#key). No fee is charged for the copying traffic in this case, because the traffic is internal for the object storage. However, you are [charged](../../pricing.md#prices-operations) for copy requests.

If bucket objects are encrypted, first they will be copied to the host that executes the command and then uploaded to the target bucket.

Large objects uploaded using [multipart uploads](../../concepts/multipart.md) are stored in the bucket in parts. They are copied by invoking [copyPart](../../s3/api-ref/multipart/copypart.md) for each part. Therefore, multipart objects cost more to copy than regular ones.

You can copy either the [entire bucket contents](#copy-from-bucket-to-bucket) or an [individual bucket object](#copy-single-object). You can also copy objects between [buckets of different organizations](#copy-to-another-org-bucket).

## Copying a single object {#copy-single-object}

{% list tabs %}

- AWS CLI

   1. If you do not have the AWS CLI yet, [install and configure it](../../tools/aws-cli.md).
   1. Run the following command:

      ```bash
      aws --endpoint-url=https://{{ s3-storage-host }}/ \
        s3 cp s3://<source_bucket>/<object_key> s3://<target_bucket>/<object_key>
      ```

      Where:

      * `--endpoint-url`: {{ objstorage-name }} endpoint.
      * `s3 cp`: Copy object command.

      Result:

      ```text
      copy: s3://<source_bucket>/<object_key> to s3://<target_bucket>/<object_key>
      ```

      For more information about the `aws s3 cp` command, see the [AWS CLI Command Reference](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/s3/cp.html).

## Copying all bucket objects to another bucket {#copy-from-bucket-to-bucket}

{% list tabs %}

- AWS CLI

   1. If you do not have the AWS CLI yet, [install and configure it](../../tools/aws-cli.md).
   1. Run the following command:

      ```bash
      aws --endpoint-url=https://{{ s3-storage-host }}/ \
        s3 cp --recursive s3:<source_bucket>/ s3:<target_bucket>/
      ```

      Where:

      * `--endpoint-url`: {{ objstorage-name }} endpoint.
      * `s3 cp`: Copy object command.
      * `--recursive`: Parameter for copying all objects from the source bucket.

      For more information about the `aws s3 cp` command, see the [AWS CLI Command Reference](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/s3/cp.html).

   All objects from the source bucket will be copied to the target bucket.

   {% note info %}

   You can copy objects between buckets either within a single cloud or between different clouds. To do this, make sure your [service account](../../../iam/concepts/users/service-accounts.md) has write permissions for both buckets.

## Copying objects to a bucket in a different organization {#copy-to-another-org-bucket}

To copy objects to a bucket hosted in a different [organization](../../../overview/roles-and-resources.md), [create](../../../iam/operations/sa/create.md) two service accounts: one with the [`storage.viewer`](../../security/index.md#storage-viewer) role for the source bucket and the other one with the [`storage.editor`](../../security/index.md#storage-editor) role for the target bucket.

{% list tabs %}

- AWS CLI

   1. If you do not have the AWS CLI yet, [install and configure it](../../tools/aws-cli.md) for each organization.
   1. Set the target bucket's [access control list (ACL)](../../concepts/acl.md) with full access permissions granted to the source bucket's service account:

      ```bash
      aws --endpoint-url=https://{{ s3-storage-host }}/ \
        s3api --profile <path_to_configuration_file> \
        --bucket <target_bucket_name> \
        --grant-full-control id=<service_account_ID>
      ```

      Where:

      * `--endpoint-url`: {{ objstorage-name }} endpoint.
      * `--profile`: Path to the AWS CLI [configuration file](../../tools/aws-cli.md#config-files) for the organization hosting the target bucket.
      * `--bucket`: Target bucket name.
      * `--grant-full-control`: Parameter for granting the source bucket's service account access to the target bucket.

   1. Copy the object:

      ```bash
      aws --endpoint-url=https://{{ s3-storage-host }}/ \
        s3 cp --profile <path_to_configuration_file> \
        s3://<source_bucket>/<object_key> \
        s3://<target_bucket>/<object_key>
      ```

      Where:

      * `--endpoint-url`: {{ objstorage-name }} endpoint.
      * `--profile`: Path to the AWS CLI configuration file for the organization hosting the target bucket.
      * `s3 cp`: Copy object command.

      To copy all objects from the source bucket, use the `--recursive` parameter.

      Result:

      ```text
      copy: s3://<source_bucket>/<object_key> to s3://<target_bucket>/<object_key>
      ```

      For more information about the `aws s3 cp` command, see the [AWS CLI Command Reference](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/s3/cp.html).
