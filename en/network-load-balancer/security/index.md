## What roles do I need {#choosing-roles}

The table below lists the roles needed to perform a particular action. You can always assign a role granting more permissions than the role specified. For example, you can assign the `editor` role instead of the `viewer` one.

Any operations with a network load balancer that has a public IP address require the `load-balancer.admin` role. In networks where target groups are located, you can have the `vpc.publicAdmin` role instead. Operations on the internal network load balancer require the `load-balancer.privateAdmin` role and operations on its target groups â€” the `load-balancer.privateAdmin` or `compute.admin` role.

Operations on target groups located in subnets, where the specified administrative roles are missing, require the `vpc.user` role for these subnets.
