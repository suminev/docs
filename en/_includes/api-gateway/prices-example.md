Let's assume, you created an API gateway that processed 10,000,000 requests over HTTPS.

The cost of this API gateway will be:

> 0.96 × ((10,000,000 – 100,000) / 1,000,000) = $9.504

Where:
* 0.96: Price per 1 million API gateway calls.
* 10,000,000: Number of requests over HTTPS.
* 100,000 is subtracted because the first one hundred thousand calls are free of charge.
* 1,000,000 is the divisor used to calculate the number of millions of requests over HTTPS.
