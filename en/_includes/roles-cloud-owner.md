The `{{ roles-cloud-owner }}` role assigned for a cloud makes a user a cloud owner. An owner can perform any operation with the cloud and the resources within it.

Only a cloud owner can assign and revoke a user's `{{ roles-cloud-owner }}` role.

A cloud must have at least one owner. The user creating a cloud becomes its owner automatically. Sole cloud owners cannot take this role away from themselves.
