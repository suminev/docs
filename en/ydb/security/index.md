# Access management in {{ ydb-name }}

{{ yandex-cloud }} users can only perform operations on resources that are allowed by the roles assigned to them. If a user does not have any roles assigned, almost all operations are forbidden.

To allow access to {{ ydb-short-name }} resources (databases and database users), assign the required roles from the list below to the Yandex account, [service account](../../iam/concepts/users/service-accounts.md), [federated users](../../iam/concepts/federations.md), [user group](../../organization/operations/manage-groups.md), or [system group](../../iam/concepts/access-control/system-group.md). Currently, a role can only be assigned to a parent resource (folder or cloud). Roles are inherited by nested resources.

Only users with the `admin`, `resource-manager.clouds.owner`, or `organization-manager.organizations.owner` role for a resource can assign roles for this resource.

{% note info %}

For more information about role inheritance, see [{#T}](../../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#access-rights-inheritance) in the {{ resmgr-full-name }} documentation.
