# Subscribing to notifications

By using subscriptions, you will never miss changes in the issues that are important to you. If someone edits an issue you are subscribed to, you will get notified by email.

You can subscribe both to a specific issue and to all the issues related to a specific queue, version, or component.

You can [set up the content](notification-settings.md) of your notifications and subscriptions to get emails only on the events that are relevant for you.

{% note info %}

Notifications about invitations to comments are also displayed in the {{ tracker-name }} [notification center](#notif_call_comments).

{% endnote %}
