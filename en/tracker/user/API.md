# API {{ tracker-name }}

Manage your {{ tracker-name }} issues using HTTP requests to the [{{ tracker-full-name }} REST API](../about-api.md).

The {{ tracker-full-name }} API is designed for web services and apps that work with your organization's issues on behalf of a user. The API features depend on the access rights of the user making the requests.

Use the {{ tracker-name }} API to:

- Integrate {{ tracker-name }} with other services. For example, use a chatbot to manage issues or link {{ tracker-name }} to your CRM system.
- Automate processes, such as creating, bulk changing, and finding issues by parameter.
- Set specific rules for processing certain actions. For example, you can set a timer for updating an issue's status.
- Create web browser extensions for managing {{ tracker-name }}.

For more information about how to use the {{ tracker-name }} API, see the [Reference](../about-api.md).
