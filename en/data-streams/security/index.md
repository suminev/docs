# Access management in {{ yds-name }}

{{ yds-name }} uses [roles](../../iam/concepts/access-control/roles.md) to manage access rights.

{{ yandex-cloud }} users can only perform operations on resources that are allowed by the roles assigned to them. If a user does not have any roles assigned, almost all operations are forbidden.

To allow access to {{ yds-full-name }} resources (data streams, {{ ydb-full-name }} databases storing them, and database users), assign the Yandex account, [service account](../../iam/concepts/users/service-accounts.md), [federated users](../../iam/concepts/federations.md), [user group](../../organization/operations/manage-groups.md), or [system group](../../iam/concepts/access-control/system-group.md) the required roles from the list below. Currently, a role can only be assigned to a parent resource (folder or cloud). Roles are inherited by nested resources.

Only users with the `admin`, `resource-manager.clouds.owner`, or `organization-manager.organizations.owner` role for a resource can assign roles for this resource.

{% note info %}

For more information about role inheritance, see [{#T}](../../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#access-rights-inheritance) in the {{ resmgr-full-name }} documentation.
