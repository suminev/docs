# {{ forms-full-name }} revision history for December 2023

* [Renamed a button](#button-name).
* [Increased the limit on the number of attached files](#upgrade-limit).

## Renamed a button {#button-name}

Previously, when survey respondents encountered a [**Series of questions**](../blocks-ref/series.md), they needed to click **Add a series of questions** to provide more answers to the questions in the series. User feedback showed us that respondents found this button name confusing. Based on this feedback, we decided to rename the button to **One more**.

## Increased the limit on the number of attached files {#upgrade-limit}

With {{ forms-name }}, you can [attach](../blocks-ref/file.md#alow-multi) up to 20 files to a single form. Now this limit can be increased even further if you enable [saving files from responses to an external storage](../storage-for-attached-files.md). In this case, you can attach up to 50 files to a single form.
