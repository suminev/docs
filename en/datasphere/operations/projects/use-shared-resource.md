# Using shared resources

In your project, you can use a resource available to the entire community. To share resources with community members, the `{{ roles-datasphere-project-admin }}` role is required.

To use a shared resource:

1. {% include [include](../../../_includes/datasphere/ui-find-project.md) %}
1. Select the resource under **{{ ui-key.yc-ui-datasphere.project-page.project-resources }}**.
1. Go to the **{{ ui-key.yc-ui-datasphere.common.shared-with-project-resources }}** tab.
1. Click ![options](../../../_assets/console-icons/ellipsis.svg) next to the resource and select **{{ ui-key.yc-ui-datasphere.common.add-to-project }}**.
