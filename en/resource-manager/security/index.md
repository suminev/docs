## What roles do I need {#required-roles}

The table below lists the roles needed to perform a particular action. You can always assign a role granting more permissions than the role specified. For example, you can assign the `editor` role instead of the `viewer` one.

| Action | Methods | Required roles |
----- | ----- | -----
| **View data** | |
| View information about any resource | `get`, `list` | `viewer` for this resource |
| View information about a folder or cloud | `get`, `list` | `resource-manager.viewer` for the folder or cloud |
| View metadata about a folder or cloud | `get`, `list` | `resource-manager.auditor` for the folder or cloud |
| **Manage resources** | |
| [Create a cloud](../operations/cloud/create.md) | | To create your first cloud, no roles are required. You only need to authenticate (a user is automatically assigned the `resource-manager.clouds.owner` role in the created organization). Afterwards, the `resource-manager.editor` or `editor` role for the organization is required. |
| [Update a cloud](../operations/cloud/update.md) | `update` | `editor` or `resource-manager.editor` for the cloud |
| [Deleting a cloud](../operations/cloud/delete.md) | `delete` | `resource-manager.clouds.owner` for a cloud |
| [Create a folder in the cloud](../operations/folder/create.md) | `create` | `editor` or `resource-manager.editor` for the cloud |
| [Updating a folder](../operations/folder/update.md) | `update` | `editor` or `resource-manager.editor` for the folder |
| [Deleting a folder](../operations/folder/delete.md) | `delete` | `editor` or `resource-manager.editor` for the folder |
| **Managing resource access** | |
| Inviting a new user to an organization | | `{{ roles-organization-admin }}` |
| [Make a new user the owner of the cloud](../operations/cloud/set-access-bindings.md) | `setAccessBindings`, `updateAccessBindings` | `resource-manager.clouds.owner` for the cloud |
| View roles granted for a resource | `listAccessBindings` | `viewer` for this resource |
| View roles granted for the folder or cloud | `listAccessBindings` | `resource-manager.viewer` for the folder or cloud |
| [Assign a role](../../iam/operations/roles/grant.md) and [revoke a role](../../iam/operations/roles/revoke.md) for the folder or cloud | `setAccessBindings`, `updateAccessBindings` | `admin` or `resource-manager.admin` for the folder or cloud |
